# Inventor Kit Experiments

## Instructions ##

*For a selection of 5 inventor kit experiments that you choose, fill out the following sections.

### Experiment name ###

Say "Hello"to the BBC

#### Photo of completed project ####
*In the code below, replace `missingimage.png` with the name of the image, which should be in the `kitexperiments` folder.*

(Microbit set up on with breadboard, showing result of button A)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was te basics of coding with the Microbit kit, quite a simple and easy experiment helps immensly to start off my coding experience.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an experience feedback tracker, with a little more coding people in a certain situation could press a button and give simple feedback about that experience they had in that situation.

### Experiment name ###

Light Sensor and Ananlog Inputs

#### Photo of completed project ####

(Microbit and breadboard set up to sense light, and give feedback)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how interesting and applicaple light sensors are in todays world and how easy they can be to use and mould to give different types of feedback.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as automated traffic signs eg. speed warning signs, could detected light off of cars and reflect an image to tell them the current conditions

### Experiment name ###

Accelerometer to drive motor

#### Photo of completed project ####

(Microbit and Breadboard used to run motor through different components)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to connect different bits and peices to make an  object work.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as maybe an aircon system if a building was not getting enough air flow through it would increase the flow.
